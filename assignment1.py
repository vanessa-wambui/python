# Write a python program to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 70 kg and height is 1.74. BMI= (weight / height squared)

# find th area and perimeter of a rectangle whose 48cm and width is 25cm

weight = 70
height = 1.74 ** 2
BMI = weight / height
print("The BMI is:" , BMI)

length = 48
width = 25
area = length * width
print("The are of the rectangle is:", area)


length = 48 * 2
width = 25 * 2
perimeter = length + width
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is" , perimeter)
